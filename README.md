# bamazon
This is an Amazon-like storefront built with MySQL and Node.js. 

When the user is in the customer portal, you can view the inventory, choose an item you'd like to purchase
along with the quantity. If the item is in stock, the transaction  will be complete! However, if we do not have enough 
of the selected item in stock, the transaction will not go through.
